PROS of SVMs:
A significant advantage of SVMs is that whilst ANNs can suffer from multiple local minima, the solution to an SVM is global and unique.
Unlike ANNs, the computational complexity of SVMs does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space.
SVMs are less prone for overfitting
need less memory to store the predictive model
Fewer hyperparameters -> easier to find an accurate model


PROS of NNs:
They are extremely flexible in the types of data they can support. NNs learn data, the user doesn't have to manually derive them.
